# Continuous integration workflow via Github Actions
# This workflow is triggered during a push or a pull request and run the
# steps below across various configurations specified in the matrix
# (eg. python3.7, etc.):
#
#  - Setup docker environment and caching strategy
#  - Build base docker image with dependencies required for building CLIF
#  - Configure CLIF build to use python version
#  - Build CLIF
#  - Run unit tests
#  - Run integration tests
#
# Workflow can also be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch.
