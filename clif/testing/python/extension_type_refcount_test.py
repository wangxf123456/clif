"""Basic test for refcount health.

  * get initial refcount of extension type
  * construct N objects
  * assert refcount of extension type >= initial refcount  # SOFT ASSERT
  * delete the N objects
  * assert refcount of extension type == initial refcount  # HARD ASSERT

  The SOFT ASSERT means that the refcount for the extension type may or may
  not be updated when objects of that type are constructed. At the time of
  this writing, either could be considered correct. This may change in the
  future as the Python C API continues to evolve [1].

  Note that the ambituity here adds a motivation to the plan for replacing
  the current PyCLIF code generator with a new generator targeting pybind11
  instead of the Python C API directly. That will allow us to leverage the
  community investments into pybind11 (e.g. [1], [2]) instead of having to
  figure out such highly complex and evolving details independently.
